     <br><font size="3" color="red">Performance:</font> Apple sells the iPhone X in 55 countries around the world, however some manufacturing woes meant some consumers initially had to wait over a month to receive the phone

The iPhone Xs Face ID sensor reportedly took more time to assemble than expected, according to The Wall Street Journal, contributing to shipping delays. The delay was reportedly caused by an imbalanc between the so-called Romeo module, an infrared dot projector that beams more than 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of faces, and the Juliet module, which analyzes the pattern produced by those dots.

According to Bloomberg, it was earlier in the fall of 2017 that Apple realized production problems meant it wouldnt have enough iPhone Xs for the holidays. Sources familiar to the situation say Apple s solution was reportedly to let suppliers reduce the accuracy of the iPhone Xs Face ID feature. Lowering the requirements for its Face ID technology permitted the firm to speed up production. The change also sped up testing of completed modules.
